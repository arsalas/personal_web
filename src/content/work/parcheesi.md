This project is an arcade game adaptation of the classic **Parcheesi**, developed for a coin-operated machine. 

The game supports up to four players with **multiple game modes** and timed gameplay activated upon coin insertion. 
Players can **create profiles**, customize avatars, and accumulate points with each win. 

The game includes a localization system to support **multiple languages**, enhancing accessibility for diverse players. 

Additionally, an integrated service menu provides the machine owner with a technical assistance interface, allowing them to track business metrics and adjust various game settings.
