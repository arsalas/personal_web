#### Description

Development of a cooperative game prototype in **Unreal Engine 5** for the **Level Up 2024 Game Jam**. 

The project involved creating a **cooperative gameplay system** for three characters, each with unique abilities (warrior, mage, archer). 

Combat mechanics, dungeon exploration, and basic puzzle solving were implemented. To achieve a seamless gameplay experience, a character navigation system (AI) and a collision detection system were utilized. 

The game features a basic save system and a functional main menu. 

Programming was primarily done in Blueprint.
