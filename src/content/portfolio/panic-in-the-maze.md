#### Description

For this game jam project, I developed "Panic in the Maze" using **Godot**, exploring the technical constraints reminiscent of classic **Game Boy games**. Players navigate through a series of intricate mazes, racing against the clock as their flashlight battery drains. The objective is to find the exit before plunging into darkness.

As players traverse the labyrinths, they encounter ghosts that increase the difficulty of their quest, creating a tense atmosphere and challenging gameplay. This project not only allowed me to dive deep into the **Godot engine** but also provided valuable experience in crafting an engaging retro-style game under time constraints.

Through this experience, I enhanced my skills in game design, level creation, and implementing mechanics that evoke nostalgia while delivering a unique gameplay experience.
