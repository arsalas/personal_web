Development of a cooperative game prototype in Unreal Engine 5 for the Level Up 2024 Game Jam. The project involved creating a cooperative gameplay system for three players, each with unique abilities (warrior, mage, archer). Combat mechanics, dungeon exploration, and basic puzzle solving were implemented. To achieve a seamless gameplay experience, a character navigation system (AI) and a collision detection system were utilized. The game features a basic save system and a functional main menu. Programming was primarily done in Blueprint.
