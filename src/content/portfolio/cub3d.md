#### Description
Within the **42 curriculum**, the **cub3D** project was developed as a tribute to the groundbreaking **Wolfenstein 3D**. 

The main goal was to understand the mechanisms behind 3D rendering engines using **C** and miniLibX. Through the implementation of a **ray-casting algorithm**, a 3D maze was created. 

This project not only reinforced programming skills but also allowed for the application of mathematical concepts like trigonometry and geometry in a practical setting.
