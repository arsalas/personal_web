Within the 42 curriculum, the cub3D project was developed as a tribute to the groundbreaking Wolfenstein 3D. The main goal was to understand the mechanisms behind 3D rendering engines using C and miniLibX. Through the implementation of a ray-casting algorithm, a 3D maze was created. This project not only reinforced programming skills but also allowed for the application of mathematical concepts like trigonometry and geometry in a practical setting.
