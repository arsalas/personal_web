### **Description:**  
*A Secret Sleeping in the Deep Sea* is a 2D arcade-style game developed entirely in **Unity**, where players control a pufferfish navigating through a vibrant underwater world. The goal is to collect as many pearls as possible while avoiding dangerous sharks that threaten your journey.

### **Key Features:**
- **Fluid Gameplay:**  
   The game features constant horizontal movement, responsive jumping mechanics, and collision detection for a smooth and engaging experience.
- **Dynamic Leaderboard Integration:**  
   A **Supabase**-powered leaderboard allows players to record and compare their scores globally. High scores are submitted via secure RESTful API calls, and the top 10 players' scores are dynamically retrieved and displayed on an in-game leaderboard UI.
- **Polished Visuals and Physics:**  
   Unity's robust 2D physics system was utilized to create realistic character movement and interactions, ensuring an immersive underwater experience.

### **Technical Details:**
- Developed using **Unity**, showcasing expertise in 2D game development.  
- Integrated **Supabase** for real-time database management, including score submission and retrieval.  
- Designed a user-friendly leaderboard interface to enhance competition and replayability.  
- Optimized for browser-based play, ensuring smooth performance on platforms like **itch.io**.

### **What Makes It Unique?**
This project combines creative game design with technical implementation, demonstrating not only my proficiency in Unity but also my ability to integrate backend services like Supabase to deliver an engaging and competitive experience for players.

<!-- #### Description

Ocean Pearl Adventure is a 2D arcade-style game developed in Unity, where players control a pufferfish navigating through a vibrant underwater world. The objective is to collect as many pearls as possible while avoiding dangerous sharks that swim through the ocean. The game features smooth mechanics, including constant horizontal movement, jumping functionality, and collision detection for an engaging player experience.

The game was built entirely in Unity, showcasing its powerful 2D development capabilities. Unity's physics system was used to manage character movement and collision interactions, ensuring a polished and fluid gameplay experience.

To add a competitive edge, a leaderboard system was implemented using Supabase. This integration allows players to record their high scores in real-time and compete globally. The connection to Supabase was achieved through RESTful API calls, ensuring secure data transmission and seamless integration of user scores. Additionally, Supabase's features for backend management made it possible to retrieve and display the top 10 high scores dynamically on a leaderboard UI created within Unity.

This project demonstrates not only my technical skills in Unity for game development but also my ability to integrate external services like Supabase for database management and real-time data synchronization, enhancing both the gameplay and user experience.
