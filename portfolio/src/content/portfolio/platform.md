This 3D platformer, entirely developed in Unreal Engine 5, offers a challenging and fun experience. Players will need to demonstrate their jumping and precision skills to overcome obstacles and defeat cunning enemies that employ patrol patterns and pursuit tactics. The realistic physics of the moving platforms add an extra layer of complexity to the gameplay. Additionally, the game features a custom particle system that creates stunning visual effects, such as explosions and dust particles. Collecting coins unlocks new levels and character upgrades.
