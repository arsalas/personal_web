A video game developed in Unreal Engine 4 based in Metal Gear Solid for my master's thesis. The game features enemy AI with sight and hearing, enabling stealth gameplay. The protagonist can run, crouch, and swim, while a variety of weapons and gadgets, like scopes, are available. Levels include interactive elements such as night vision and puzzle-solving. The game culminates in a challenging boss fight with adaptive tactics.
